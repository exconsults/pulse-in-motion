## What Lovable manages

Rules outside this block are the project's own. Change the pieces below in
Lovable, not by hand. With the [Lovable MCP](https://mcp.lovable.dev)
connected, `send_message` asks Lovable to do it; otherwise ask the user to
use the editor.

- **Database.** Do not add or edit `supabase/migrations/` or `drizzle/`.
  Ask Lovable to change the schema.
- **Generated files.** Do not edit a file whose header says it is automatically
  generated.
- **AI gateway.** Keep model calls on Lovable's gateway, and keep
  `LOVABLE_API_KEY` out of browser code.
- **Connectors.** Lovable provides native connectors. `list_connectors` shows
  which are enabled; `add_connector` only returns the dashboard link. When a
  connector is enabled, calls go through the connector gateway and need
  `LOVABLE_API_KEY`. When Lovable does not provide one, users can bring their
  own key and store it in Secrets.
- **Secrets.** Lovable manages them. Do not put secret values in the repo.

- The Presage SmartSpectra SDK runs only natively (Node FFI), so it lives in `bridge/` as a local companion that streams metrics over ws://localhost:8787; the web app falls back to an in-browser pulse estimate when the bridge is absent. Why: the SDK can't run in the browser or on the edge runtime, and the API key must stay on the user's machine.
- Companion launchers use a shared Node setup prompt and a loopback-only, origin-checked, single-session WebSocket with validated RGBA frames; this keeps key handling platform-neutral and prevents unrelated sites or malformed input from reaching the native SDK.
- Browser pulse estimation samples only a detected-face forehead region and clears samples when the face is lost, so background motion cannot be presented as human vitals.
